The data are reading and writing score for a random sample high school seniors in the nation.

Create a function
```{r}
high_residuals<-function(x, y, p)
{results<-lm(y~x)
results$residuals<-abs(results$residuals)
results$residuals<-sort(results$residuals, decreasing=F)
tenth_largest<-head(tail(results$residuals, p),1)
ifelse(results$residuals>=tenth_largest, "TRUE", "FALSE")
}
```

we will create a scatterplot to show the relationship between two variables.
```{r echo=TRUE}
library(here)
hsb<-read.csv(here("Data","hsb2.csv"))
hsb
p<-nrow(hsb)*0.1
p
high_residual2<-high_residuals(hsb$read, hsb$write, p)
high_residual2
scatter_plot<-plot(hsb$read, hsb$write,
                   main="Regression for writing on reading", 
                  xlab="Reading", ylab="Writing",
                  col=ifelse(high_residual2, "red","black"))
abline(lm(write~read, data=hsb), col="red")
```




```
